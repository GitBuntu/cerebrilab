# Responsible AI Principles Summary

This document synthesizes the core principles from three authoritative AI governance frameworks:  
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)  
- OECD AI Principles  
- Microsoft Responsible AI Standard  

Each section provides a concise 5‑bullet synthesis suitable for academic, engineering, and governance contexts.

## 1. NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)

- Provides a voluntary, risk‑based framework to help organizations manage AI risks to individuals, organizations, and society.  
- Centers on building **trustworthy AI** through the functions: Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage.  
- Developed via an open, multi‑stakeholder process to ensure broad applicability across sectors.  
- Designed to be interoperable with global governance efforts and regulatory environments.  
- Emphasizes continuous risk identification, measurement, mitigation, and monitoring across the AI lifecycle.

## 2. OECD AI Principles

- The first intergovernmental AI governance standard, adopted by 42+ countries.  
- Promotes **innovative and trustworthy AI** that respects human rights, democratic values, and the rule of law.  
- Calls for transparency, robustness, safety, and ongoing risk assessment.  
- Requires that AI systems support inclusive growth, sustainable development, and societal well‑being.  
- Establishes accountability expectations for developers, deployers, and operators of AI systems.

## 3. Microsoft Responsible AI Principles

- Built around six core principles: **Fairness, Reliability & Safety, Privacy & Security, Inclusiveness, Transparency, Accountability**.  
- Operationalized through the Microsoft Responsible AI Standard, which translates principles into engineering requirements.  
- Provides practical tools, transparency notes, and governance structures for real‑world implementation.  
- Emphasizes human oversight, documentation, and system intelligibility to support responsible decision‑making.  
- Aims to ensure AI systems empower all people, regardless of background or ability.
